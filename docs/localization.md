# Interface language

Choose **Menu > Edit > Preferences…** (Command-comma on macOS, Ctrl-comma elsewhere) **> Interface language** and select **Auto**, **English**, **日本語**, **简体中文**, **繁體中文**, **Čeština** or **Português (Brasil)**. The change applies immediately and persists between launches. Command ids, document contents and file names are unchanged.

**Auto** (the default) follows the system language: `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES` or `LANG`, then the preferred-languages list on macOS. Any Portuguese locale (`pt_BR`, `pt_PT`) uses the Brazilian catalog, and Chinese locales for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (`zh_TW`, `zh_HK`, `zh_MO`, `zh-Hant`) the Traditional Chinese one; other Chinese locales (`zh`, `zh_CN`, `zh_SG`, `zh-Hans`) the Simplified Chinese one. A system language without a catalog, such as French, shows English. Windows has no system-language detection yet, so **Auto** shows English there unless `LANG` is set.

The control channel exposes the setting through `ui.set`:

```json
{"method":"ui.set","params":{"key":"language","value":"ja"}}
```

The value is `auto` or a language code (`en`, `ja`, `zh-hans`, `zh-hant`, `cs`, `pt-br`), in any case. `ui.state` reports `language` as written in the preferences (`auto`, `en`, `ja`, `zh-hans`, `zh-hant`, `cs` or `pt-br`). Unknown values return an error without changing the current setting. Preferences saved before this setting existed follow the system language.

Dialogs, panels, menus, notices and history labels go through the catalog (`tl!`). Japanese and Traditional Chinese translate them (about 1,800 entries each), Simplified Chinese most of them (about 1,600); Czech and Brazilian Portuguese cover the menus so far. Untranslated labels use English. Error details that come from the engine or the operating system are shown as they are, inside a translated frame ("操作「…」に失敗しました: …"). The command palette matches the translated label, the English label and the command id. Vertical Japanese PDF rendering is an existing viewer feature; this change does not add vertical text editing.

Japanese interface text uses BIZ UDPGothic from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), an optional build input that every release includes (`CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`; see the README). A build made without it has no Japanese face, so Japanese labels show replacement boxes. Chinese is drawn with the same craft-fonts CJK faces (in Simplified Chinese the `Hans` faces come first, so a line never mixes faces with different baselines), so a character none of them has shows a replacement box (and every Chinese character does in a build without craft-fonts). Czech and Brazilian Portuguese need only the bundled Latin faces (tested in `tests/fonts.rs`).

## How translations work

PdfCraft uses the same system as PhotoCraft (`crates/ui-egui/src/i18n/`):

- Strings in the code stay in English and serve as lookup keys. At draw time, `tl!("Save")` returns the text in the current language, and falls back to English when there is no entry.
- Each language has a catalog, `crates/ui-egui/src/i18n/<code>.tsv`, with one entry per line: `context<TAB>English<TAB>translation`. An empty context marks a plain string. `@id` keys an entry by command id (for example `file.saveAs`), so one menu item can read differently from another with the same English label. `@plural` holds plural forms. Any other context disambiguates an English word with several meanings (`tr_ctx`). The header of `ja.tsv` documents the format and escapes.
- Placeholders (`{name}`) must appear in both columns. A trailing `…` must be kept. `i18n::fmt` fills placeholders in one pass, so a value such as a file name containing `{n}` is inserted as written.
- Catalogs are validated strictly: unknown escapes, unknown `@` contexts, placeholder or ellipsis mismatches, wrong plural form counts and duplicates are errors. The tests require the bundled catalogs to have none; at run time a bad line is skipped (and logged) and that string shows in English.
- Catalogs are assets: each `.tsv` has an `ATTRIBUTION.toml` entry with `kind = "translation"` and its SHA-256, checked by `cargo xtask assets`.
- Translations are clean-room: write them from the meaning of the English text, never from another product's string tables.

## Adding a language

1. Copy the header of `ja.tsv` into `xx.tsv` and translate entries.
2. Add one row to `LANGUAGES` in `crates/ui-egui/src/i18n/mod.rs`: code, native name, catalog and plural rule.
3. Add an `ATTRIBUTION.toml` entry for the catalog (`kind = "translation"`), then run `cargo xtask assets --write` and `cargo xtask assets`.

The Preferences dropdown, the system-language match and the catalog tests (format, duplicates, placeholders, plural forms, command ids) then pick it up.
